# compositeNUVs
Collection of methods to perform various model-based signal processing tasks with NUV priors. In particular, the newly proposed _One-Hot_ and _Normal Node_ composite NUV priors are implemented. They are further used to build a model selector and a covariance estimation method, respectively, along with some more advanced models.
